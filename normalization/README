Code and patches for unifying the behavior of upstream Metis and my version.

When built with the `normalized` feature (currently on by default), the output
of the C version (build via ../metis-normalized.nix) and Rust version should be
identical. This means that not only the graph output but also the debug output
should be diffable.

Note that these patches don't fix any major bugs in the original, which is
notable in the cases when -minconn or -contig is enabled on certain graphs as
there is a (logical) buffer overrun in the original. It is possible that
differences in this when these flags are enabled are due to that buffer
overrun. 

For this reason, it is recommended have asserts disabled. While it is common to
fail an assert, it is far less common for the output to be affected unless the
graph has very uniform degree distribution.
